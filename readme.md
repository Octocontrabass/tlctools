TLCTools
========

Tools for extracting data from Road Adventures USA, and maybe other games too.

TLCExtract
----------

Extracts the contents of .TLC archives into individual files. The archives
don't seem to include file names, so output files are numbered according to
their position in the table of contents.

CBMExtract
----------

Extracts the contents of .CBM archives into individual .JPG files. The
archives don't include file names, so output images are numbered according to
their position in the table of contents.
